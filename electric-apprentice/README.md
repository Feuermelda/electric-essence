# Electric Apprentice

A collection of guided learning projects created during my Electric Essence journey.<br>
These projects were built with step-by-step support from ChatGPT and explore key concepts like LEDs, sensors, analog input, PWM, and logic chaining.

## Projects

| Project                                    | Description                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Buzzer Motion**                          | Motion-activated buzzer alarm                                                                                                     |
| **Button Awakens**                         | 4 Versions                                                                                                                        |
| • *Classic Press*                          | Holding the button turns the red LED on; releasing it turns the LED off.                                                          |
| • *Toggle Mode*                            | Each button press toggles the red LED on or off.                                                                                  |
| • *Short vs Long Press*                    | A short press flashes the red LED once; a long press causes it to blink multiple times.                                           |
| • *Combo Trigger*                          | Two quick button presses trigger a green LED (success). If the second press is too slow, the red LED blinks as a failure warning. |
| **Sound Thief**                            | LED glows in response to a detected sound, stays on briefly, and then turns off.                                                  |
| **RGB Mode Switcher**                      | 5 Versions                                                                                                                        |
| • *Potentiometer-controlled Rainbow Speed* | Brightness of solid color changes depending on knob position                                                                      |
| • *Color Rainbow Fade*                     | LED cycles through rainbow colors                                                                                                 |
| • *Color Mood Light*                       | RGB LED cycles through red, green, and blue colors, but only when a button is pressed.                                            |
| • *Auto-dimming RGB Nightlight*            | In Mode 1 (solid warm red), LED dims based on ambient light                                                                       |
| • *Mode Button*                            | Light switches between three different modes: Off, solid warm red, rainbow fade                                                   |
| **Shadow Sentinel**                        | Trigger LED only when it's dark and motion is detected. Stays on for 2 seconds before it turns off again.                         |
| • *Shadow Sentinel Ultrasonic*             | Proximity-reactive LED that only activates in the dark, using both a photoresistor and ultrasonic sensor.                         |
| **Echo Chamber**                           | If Motion and Sound detected, the LED lights up.                                                                                  |
