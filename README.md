# Electric Essence

Welcome to **Electric Essence** - a playful and powerful learning path where circuits come to life.<br>
This repository contains all electronics projects I've built with Arduino as part of my hands-on journey.

**Board Used:** Arduino UNO R3 (Elegoo clone version)

## Structure

- [`electric-apprentice/`](./electric-apprentice/) - Guided lab builds with support from ChatGPT
- [`essence-originals/`](./essence-originals/) - My solo creative designs, written on my own

## Mission

To explore the core principles of electronics by creating real, working circuits.<br>
Each project builds toward fluency with components, code, and system behavior.<br>
This repo is part of my [Electric Essence Learning Path](https://github.com/Feuermelda/electric-essence.git) into embedded systems and hands-on coding.
