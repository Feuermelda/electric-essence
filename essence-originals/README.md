# Essence Originals

These are projects I designed and built independently, based on everything I've learned in Electric Apprentice<br>
They reflect my personal creativity, problem-solving, and style.

| **Alarm Candle**        | LED glows peacefully when idle, becomes disturbed when button pressed.                                              |
| **Birthday Cake**       | Candle simulator where LEDs light up when button presses and flicker until you fully blow them out.                 |
| **Responsive Feedback** | 3 Versions                                                                                                          |
| • *Memory Bloom*        | A single LED lights up in response to sound, only when it's dark.                                                   |
| • *Shadow Memory*       | An LED stays  on after detecting sound in the dark, like a short-term memory trigger.                               |
| • *Resonant Bloom*      | An RGB LED blooms with warm light when sound is heard in darkness, blending analog values for a soft reactive glow. |
| • **Moodlight Quartet** | An RGB LED that reacts to light and motion in four different ways.                                                  |
